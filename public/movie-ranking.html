   <h1>The Top Movies In Cinema History(According To Moi)</h1> 
   <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
     <hr>
         <h3>Star Wars</h3>
 <p>
    My all-time favrite saga. For me, episodes 1-6 are a work of art, a masterpiece. Unfortunetly, this does
    not include episodes 7-9.

         <h3>Blade Runner</h3>
 <p>
    An incredible sci-fi classic. It even has a wonderfully entertaining sequel made later in the late 2010's
 </p>     
         <h3>Forest Gump</h3>           
 <p>
    A classic romance drama staring Tom Hanks. A movie full of laughs and can be
    a bit of a tear jerker.
